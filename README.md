# The Dummy Cannon (Full game source upload pending)
A thing I made on Unity to get more confident with the engine and its UI system. It's meant to be a casual time-waster.

Adjust the cannon's angles and strenght with the sliders and fire the dummy to get as close to the flag as possible. You will be evaluated based on how close you landed.

You can play it at https://francescoconso.itch.io/the-dummy-cannon
The password is "Dummy", with a uppercase D.

A hint: The furthest you can fire the dummy is about 100 meters...
